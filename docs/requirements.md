# Project Requirements Specification

## Source Guidance
This project is informed by publicly available CDC guidance on laboratory
exposure to *Burkholderia pseudomallei* and *B. mallei*.

## Core Features
- Educational exposure risk categorization
- Clear reporting and notification pathways
- Conceptual follow-up timelines
- Explicit handling of *B. mallei* serology limitations

## Explicit Exclusions
- No laboratory techniques
- No organism identification
- No clinical treatment instructions
- No antibiotic dosing
- No operational response protocols

## Ethical Principles
- Synthetic data only
- Education and awareness focus
- Systems-based perspective

## Design Rationale Informed by Published Evidence

Published analyses of U.S. laboratory exposure events demonstrate that:
- Most reported exposures involve multiple personnel
- High-risk events are associated with aerosolization or mucous membrane exposure
- Serological monitoring is commonly performed over several weeks
- Clinical disease following laboratory exposure remains rare

These findings informed the simulator’s focus on:
- Exposure categorization rather than organism identification
- Reporting and communication workflows
- Conceptual follow-up timelines rather than treatment
