## One-Page Project Summary

**Project:** Burkholderia pseudomallei Exposure Awareness & Reporting Simulator

**Purpose:**  
Educational simulation demonstrating how healthcare systems recognize and
respond to potential rare-pathogen exposure events through communication and
reporting pathways.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Systems thinking
- Occupational safety awareness
- Epidemiology-to-clinical translation
- Ethical data handling
- Clear technical communication

**Relevance to Medicine**
This project aligns with Internal Medicine by emphasizing patient safety,
interdisciplinary coordination, and prevention of avoidable harm through
systems-level awareness.

Published surveillance of U.S. laboratory exposure events demonstrates that
occupational exposures may be under-recognized, often involve multiple
personnel, and frequently require prolonged monitoring despite the rarity
of clinical disease. These findings highlight the importance of early
recognition, documentation, and communication across laboratory, clinical,
and public health systems.
